# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction Model

A comprehensive **Movie Rating Prediction Model** built with Python that leverages data analysis techniques to predict movie ratings based on historical data. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and preprocessing to build a solid foundation for predictive modeling.

> **Note**: This project is still under development. Features may change, and new functionalities will be added over time.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Data Cleaning:
- **Missing Value Handling**: Identified and addressed missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted columns to appropriate data types, including dates to datetime objects for time series analysis.
- **Standardization**: Cleaned and standardized categorical variables, such as genres and languages.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations to analyze the distribution of numerical features (e.g., budgets, revenues, ratings) using various plotting techniques.
- **Relationships**: Investigated relationships and patterns within the data, employing bar plots, count plots, and line charts for insights.

### Feature Engineering:
- **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler` to enhance model performance.
- **Encoding**: Applied encoding techniques, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables, to prepare data for modeling.

### Additional EDA:
- **Post-Preprocessing Analysis**: Conducted further exploratory analyses after scaling and encoding to observe the impact of these transformations on the dataset.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Explored trends in movie ratings, revenue, and genre popularity over the years.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for scaling and encoding features.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Development
- **Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict movie ratings based on features like budget, genre, and release year.
- **Evaluation**: Develop evaluation metrics to assess model performance and accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Create a web application to showcase insights and allow users to interact with the prediction model.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Develop interactive visualizations for better data exploration.
