# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Rating Prediction Model

This is a **Movie Rating Prediction Model** built using Python. The model predicts movie ratings based on historical data, utilizing various data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project includes steps like data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training to make accurate predictions.

> **Note**: The project is complete and the model is ready for use. However, additional features and improvements may be added in the future.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Data Cleaning:
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing values to ensure clean and reliable data.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted columns to the correct data types (e.g., dates as datetime objects) to help with analysis.
- **Standardization**: Cleaned and standardized text data like genres and languages for better consistency.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- **Visualization**: Used charts and graphs to understand how different factors (like budget, revenue, and ratings) are distributed.
- **Patterns & Relationships**: Identified patterns and trends in the data through bar plots, line charts, and more.

### Feature Engineering:
- **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to improve model performance.
- **Encoding**: Converted categorical data (e.g., genres and languages) into numerical format using encoding techniques for modeling.

### Model Training & Evaluation:
- **Modeling**: Trained machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to predict movie ratings.
- **Evaluation**: Used metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared (RÂ²) to assess model performance and accuracy.

### Final Model:
- After training multiple models, **XGBoost** was selected as the best model based on its performance.
- The final model was saved and can be used for future predictions.

### Deployment:
- The trained model is now ready to be used for movie rating predictions based on input features like budget, genre, and release year.
